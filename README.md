Here are the apps I've created on my first colleague year, when I actually started to programming for the very first time.
Course I was taking is called 'Object-Oriented Programming' and we were using Java programming language.
It is clear from my code that back then I was pure amateur, but I kept it since I think that every step in learning is counting. :)
